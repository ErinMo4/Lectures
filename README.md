# PHYS 1600/2600 Lecture materials
**Spring 2021**
___

All lecture materials and in-class workbooks will be stored in this repository. 

Please **fork** this repo to create a local copy on your [Jupyter Hub](https://phys1600.jupyter.brown.edu), local machine, or both (the last option is best). You should also **link your fork back to upstream** and periodically pull to make sure you have up-to-date lecture materials without loosing any of your own work. I will be adding additional lecture material throughout the course. 

Instructions for forking and syncing a repo can be found at the following links:

https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

and

https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

Additional guides are also available in lectures 2 and 3 posted on Canvas. 

These lecture materials are designed to supplement, not replace, class discussions, recorded lectures, and readings.
